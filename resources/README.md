# Resources

This directory contains visual assets and metadata used for repository documentation and branding. These files are used by the READMEs and the interactive showcase but are not required for the engine's core operation.

## Directory Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| [**logo.png**](logo.png) | The primary Riff project logo. |
| [**svg/**](svg/) | Scalable icons representing supported Office hosts and Windows versions. |

## Usage Guidelines

- **Documentation:** When referencing assets in Markdown, use relative paths (e.g., `resources/logo.png`).
- **Showcase:** The `RiffShowcase.bas` example may refer to these assets for UI labels or branding when running in a host that supports image embedding (like Excel).
- **Contribution:** When adding new assets, prefer lightweight formats (SVG for icons, compressed PNG for images). Avoid large binary files that bloat the repository history.

## Attribution

Unless otherwise noted, all assets in this directory are original works created for the Riff project and are released under the same [MIT License](../LICENSE) as the source code.
